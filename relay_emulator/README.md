The emulated relays are capable of publishing GOOSE messages with TRIP and
CLOSE payloads.Hence named goose_publisher.  The emulated relay's GOOSE pattern
will be the current state published every T0 (2000milli sec). When it receives
SV message indicating a new event, emulated relay increasing state number and
publishes the event immediately or with delay indicated in SV payload. This
repeats after T1(500milli sec) with increasing sequence number. The repeation
interval doubles until it hits T0. 


The SV messages are dummy messages sent by gen event program. To generate
simple close the command is "s 0", while trip is "s 1". To generate byzantine
behaviour "b delay1 t/c_1 dleay_2 t/c_2 delay_3 t/c_3 delay_4 t/c_4". If we
want any relay to be silent make payload other than t/c. t is 1 , c is 0 and
the delay is in milliseconds.
